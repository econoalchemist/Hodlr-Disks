[![Unboxing Video](/assets/Unboxing-Thumbnail.png)](https://bitcointv.com/w/mnbd3VZW7G2L4hJLGU2uh3 "Unboxing Video")

The Hodlr Disks are packaged in a heavy-duty, sealed, non-transparent plastic bag. I liked this because any tampering that may have occurred en route would be made evident by un-repairable damage to the bag. Not that tampering would be as detrimental to a stainless steel backup device as it would be to a hardware wallet, but it's just nice to know that I received the product exactly as the manufacturer had sealed it.

Upon opening the packaging, you will find a box which contains the following items:

- 1 x Marker 
- 2 x Camera covers
- 1 x Set of ear plugs
- 5 x tamper evident seals
- 1 x Pencil
- 1 x Hodlr Disk
- 1 x Hex wrench
- 1 x Automatic punch
- 1 x Instruction manual

Hodlr Swiss really thought of everything when packaging this product, literally everything a person needs to transfer a Bitcoin seed phrase to the Hodlr Disks is included.
